**_Load a CSV of data; receive an interactive network map._**

Network maps are data visualisations that show the connections between entities - be they people, place, things, or whatever else is on your radar. Because the human brain understands imagery more easily than spreadsheets, network maps are intuitive way of understanding who's who in the you-know-what. This makes them powerful pool for understanding power networks. Being visual and interactive, they are also fun to use (sorry, Excel).

## What you need in your CSV

CSV stands for Comma Seperated File. They are simply a very plain and stripped back version of a spreadsheet you might make in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, and these programs let you export your work as a CSV.

For the CSV Network Mapper to work, your CSV/Spreadsheet needs just* three columns:

- 'node_left': Think of this as Person A  
- 'connection': Explain Person A's link to Person B
- 'node-right': Think of this as Person B

Then repeat this multiple times, putting each new pairing in a new row.

* Your CSV can have more than three more files, but only those named in the list above will be read.

That's it. Code-free analysis for always curious folks. For more tools like this, visit [constituent.au](https://constituent.au/).
