DYNE is a $100M dual use fund focused on early-stage venture capital investments in the maritime domain. Current and future technological innovation will make ocean exploration, monitoring, and utilization possible at new scales. The maritime domain comprises 70%+ of the earth’s surface and with technological advancement, 95% of the maritime domain is becoming accessible. This will have profound economic, national security, and environmental impacts. In the face of a rising great power competition, US and Allied governments are deploying massive amounts of capital, aligning policy, and creating coalitions to ensure continued leadership of the seas so that free and open access, which is critical for peace and prosperity, is possible."""
